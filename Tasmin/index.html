                <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
                  <p>
                    Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Germany, the first child of a bourgeois Jewish couple.
                    The young Albert displayed an early interest in science, but he was unhappy with the principles 
                    of obedience and conformity that governed his Catholic elementary school.

            <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars 
                of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
                 science. He is best known to the general public for his massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed
                  "the world's most famous equation"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical
                   physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</p>
